# Contributing

We really appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. Our framework is used in many commercial projects and so it's important you follow the contributing guidelines closely.

Contributions should follow these steps:

1. Discuss the change you wish to make via a discussion in the relevant module's Github repository.<br><br>
2. Assuming the discussion results in a development task, a member of the core team will create a project task on the [Framework Roadmap Board](https://github.com/orgs/juicyllama-npm/projects/1) and assign it to you, along with an issue in the relevant module's Github repository.<br><br>
3. Branch off the `main` branch and include your `issue number` along with the `task description` e.g. `feature/123-my-new-feature`. We use the following prefixes:
    - `feature/` for new features
    - `bug/` for bug fixes
    - `refactor/` for general refactoring
    - `docs/` for documentation changes
    - `test/` for test changes
    - `misc/` for other changes<br><br>
4. Write your code follow the [Code Style Guide](/developers/code-style-guide) and commit your changes to your branch.<br><br>
5. Ensure you have written tests for your changes and that they pass.<br><br>
6. If you have added a new feature (or updated an existing one), please update the documentation to reflect the changes.<br><br>
7. Once complete initiate a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch. This will trigger a review process and automated tests. If the tests fail, please fix the issues and push the changes to your branch. The tests will automatically re-run.<br><br>
8. Once a member of the core team has reviewed your contribution, changes maybe requested, once approved it will be merged into `main` and the issue will be closed.<br><br>
9. The changes will be included in the next release of the module.

## Code

All contributions should include tests. Contributions without full test coverage will not be accepted.

## Documentation

It's important that our developer documentation is kept upto date. Should you add a new feature (or updated an existing one), please ensure the documentation is updated to reflect the changes.
