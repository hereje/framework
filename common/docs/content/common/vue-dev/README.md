# Vue Dev

Just like the [dev](/developers/contributing) package for backend development, as the name suggests this is a wrapper for all your **frontend** dev packages. We wrapped them into their own package to keep the dependencies of your project to a minimum.

## Install

Install the package into your project:

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/vue-dev
```

This should be the only dev dependency you need to install.
