# Core

::alert{type="info"}
Our backend framework is built on top of the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework, if you are not familiar with NestJs we recommend you read their documentation first.

## Installation

If you are looking to install the framework for local development, visit our [install instructions here](../../gettingstarted.md#installation).

Alternatively you can install this module individually into your project from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicyllama/core):

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/core
```

## Config .env variables

You should setup your .env values to fit your enviroment. You can see the most basic `.env` setup example in the framework repo's root `.env.development`

You will build on this file during your development of the applicaiton and each module may have additional .env values which will be documented as you progress.
