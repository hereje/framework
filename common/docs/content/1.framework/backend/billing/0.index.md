# Billing

The billing module is one of the most complex and complete modules in the framework. This allows your application to support all types of payment related activties. 

Some examples include:

- Subscriptions for SaaS projects
- Payments for ecommerce
- Invoicing for service companies

And anything else that requires payments, balances, invoicing etc. 

## Install

Follow these instructions to use the billing package in your project.

### Package

Install the package into your project:

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/billing
```

### Api Backend

Import the module into your application:

```typescript
//app.module.ts
import { BillingModule } from '@juicyllama/billing'

@Module({
	imports: [
		forwardRef(() => BillingModule),
	],
})
```

Add the documentation helper into your swagger config

```typescript
//main.ts
import { installBillingDocs } from '@juicyllama/billing'

//place this below the swagger setup
redoc = installBillingDocs(redoc)
```
