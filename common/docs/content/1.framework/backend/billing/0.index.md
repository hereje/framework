# Billing

The billing module is one of the most complex and complete modules in the framework. This allows your application to support all types of payment related activties. 

Some examples include:

- Subscriptions for SaaS projects
- Payments for ecommerce
- Invoicing for service companies

And anything else that requires payments, balances, invoicing etc. 

## Install

Follow these instructions to use the billing package in your project.

### Package

Install the package into your project:

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/billing
```

### Api Backend

Import the module into your application:

```ts
//app.module.ts
import { BillingModule } from '@juicyllama/billing'

@Module({
	imports: [
		forwardRef(() => BillingModule),
	],
})
```

Add the documentation helper into your swagger config

```ts
//main.ts
import { installBillingDocs } from '@juicyllama/billing'

//place this below the swagger setup
redoc = installBillingDocs(redoc)
```

### Taking payments

1. Create Payment Method
2. Create Charge

### Subscriptions

## Crons

The billing system has a number of automated processors you can choose to apply to your system depending on your use case.

You can override the default frequency by passing `{CRON_NAME}_FREQUENCY` passing a `CronExpression` value (provided by `@nestjs/schedule`)

For example, if you wanted to invoice clients every month, you could add the following to your `.env` file

```
CRON_BILLING_INVOICES_GENERATE=1
CRON_BILLING_INVOICES_GENERATE_FREQUENCY="0 0 1 * *"
```

| Cron |Default Frequency | Description|

|`CRON_BILLING_INVOICES_RESEND`|`EVERY_10_MINUTES`|Takes a list of invoices without external ids and retry to create them|
