# AI

The AI module allows you to leverage the power of AI in your application. It provides a consistent interface for interacting with AI within the confines of our framework.

## Install

Follow these instructions to use the AI module in your project.

### Package

Install the package into your project:

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/ai
```

You will also need to install the AI engine you wish to use, we currently support:

-   [OpenAI](framework/apps/openai)

for example

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/apps-openai
```

Follow the instructions to install the relevant AI engine apps you use.

### Api Backend

Import the module into your application:

```typescript
//app.module.ts
import { AiModule } from '@juicyllama/ai'

@Module({
	imports: [
		forwardRef(() => AiModule),
	],
})
```

If you wish to expose the AI to your end users or frontend directly, you can add the documentation helper into your swagger config

```typescript
//main.ts
import { installAiDocs } from '@juicyllama/ai'

//place this below the swagger setup
redoc = installAiDocs(redoc)
```

Visit [usage](./usage) for more details on how to use the package.
