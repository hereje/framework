# Google Analytics 4

The Google Analytics app is a wrapper around the [Google Analytics Data: Node.js Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-analytics/data).
It provides a consistent interface for interacting with Google Analytics 4 API within the confines of our framework.

## App Store

In order to save the clients auth tokens, this package extends [app store](../../backend/app-store/0.index.md).

It will automatically install the Google Analytics app into the app store database when you include it in your project.

## Installation

To start using the Google Analytics app, follow these instructions:

1. Install the package

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/app-google-analytics4
```

2. Add the module to your application

```ts
// app.module.ts
import { GoogleAnalyticsModule } from '@juicyllama/app-google-analytics4'

@Module({
	imports: [GoogleAnalyticsModule.forRoot()],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

*Note: this app supports experimental feature to configure a custom mount point:
you can pass route prefix into `GoogleAnalyticsModule.forRoot()`:*

```ts
GoogleAnalyticsModule.forRoot('/my-apps/ga4')
```

This will mount application routes under the custom route instead of the default `/apps/google-analytics`

#### Environment Variables

Once your app is created in Google Cloud, you will be given the following credentials:

```bash
GA4_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
GA4_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

## Modules

Each endpoint in the Shopify API is built with it's own module, this allows you to install just the module you need, we currently support:

- [Auth](google-analytics/modules/auth.md)
- [Property](google-analytics/modules/property.md)
