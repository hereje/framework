# Getting Started

::alert{type="info"}
Our frontend framework is built on top of [Quasar](https://quasar.dev), [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) frameworks. If you are not familiar with these, we recommend you read their documentation first.

## Installation

If you are looking to install the framework for local development, visit our [install instructions here](https://docs.juicyllama.com/framework#installation).

Alternatively you can install this module individually into your project from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicyllama/frontend-core):

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/frontend-core
```

## Frontend

The frontend contains all the code needed to integrate features into your applications which work seemlessly with the backend.

These include:

- Components - Prebuilt vue components you can import into your pages.
- Helpers - Prebuilt helpers to speed up common tasks.
- Plugins - App plugins you can easily import into your applications.
- Stores - Stores you can access directly via your code.
- Types - Full typescript support for your code.
