### Running the framework

```bash

cd framework
pnpm run install:framework
pnpm run start:docker
```

If you would like to contribute to our framework, you should create a folk first and clone your folked version. See [Contributing](./developers/contributing).

### Build a client application

The real power of our framework is seen through the rapid development of client applications.

Checkout the [build a client application](https://github.com/juicyllama/client-quickstart) walkthrough to get a solid overview of our framework in action.

As our framework grows, with more applications using it, more apps added and more developers contributing, the value also increases, this network effect is the reason why we have opensourced our work.

### Postman Collection

You can access our [postman collection for the framework here](https://www.postman.com/juicyllama/workspace/framework/overview). This is a set of pre-build endpoints you can call on your local installation. 

### Development User

When you first run the application locally, it will create a default account along with an account owner you can use to authenticate with. You can use this email and password to authenticate both the API and login via the frontend.
