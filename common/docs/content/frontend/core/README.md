# Getting Started

::alert{type="info"}
Our frontend framework is built on top of [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) frameworks. If you are not familiar with Vue or Quasar, we recommend you read their documentation first.

## Installation

If you are looking to install the framework for local development, visit our [install instructions here](../../gettingstarted.md#installation).

Alternatively you can install this module individually into your project from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicyllama/frontend-core):

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/frontend-core
```

## Frontend

The frontend contains all the code needed to integrate features into your applications which work seemlessly with the backend.

These include:

- [Components](./components/) - Prebuilt vue components you can import into your pages.
- [Helpers](./helpers/) - Prebuilt helpers to speed up common tasks.
- [Plugins](./plugins/) - App plugins you can easily import into your applications.
- [Stores](./stores/) - Stores you can access directly via your code.
- [Types](./types/) - Full typescript support for your code.
