The AWS app is a nestjs wrapper around the AWS `@aws-sdk` services. It provides a consistent interface for interacting with AWS within the confines of our framework.

## Installation

The AWS App consists of many modules each of which contain their own installation instruction.

However, they all share three common `.env` values which will be injected into the modules for you:

```bash
AWS_JL_REGION
AWS_JL_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_JL_SECRET_KEY_ID
```

If you are missing a module, please [open an discussion](https://github.com/juicyllama/framework/discussions) or submit a pull request.

You can copy an existing module and update it to reflect another endpoint and submit the code as a pull request.
