# Ahrefs

The Ahrefs app is a nestjs wrapper around the [Ahrefs API](https://docs.ahrefs.com/docs/api/reference%2Fintroduction){:target="_blank"}. It provides a consistent interface for interacting with Ahrefs within the confines of our framework.

### Integration

This app has two options for integration with your project, depending on the context:

#### Environment Variables

If you require direct integration into one Ahrefs account you can use the following environment variables:

```bash
AHREFS_API_KEY=your_ahrefs_api_key
```

#### App Store

If you would like to allow your users to connect their own Ahrefs accounts and perform action via their accounts, you can use the [app store](../../backend/app-store/0.index.md) integration.

The app will be automatically added to your system apps table when you import this module into your application.

### Modules

Each endpoint (e.g. X) has been separated into its own module. You can import the modules you need into your project.

The following modules are currently supported:

::alert{type="error"}
Modules need building...
::


::alert{type="warning"}
If you are missing a module, please [open an discussion](https://github.com/juicyllama/framework/discussions) or submit a pull request.

You can copy an existing module and update it to reflect another endpoint and submit the code as a pull request.
