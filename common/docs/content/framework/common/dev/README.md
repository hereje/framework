# Dev

The dev module is a collection of packages you will need to develop your **backend** framework projects.

We have wrapped them into their own package to keep the dependencies of your project to a minimum.

## Install

Install the package into your project:

```bash
pnpm install @juicyllama/dev
```

This should be the only dev dependency you need to install.
