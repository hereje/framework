# Oauth

Typically the Oauth process can be kicked off in a few different ways:

1. From the App Store Frontend Component
2. Directly from a 3rd party App Stores
3. Via an API call

#### App Store Component

This is a pre-build GUI you can use in your project to simplify the ability for users to add apps. This wraps around 3. via an API call and handles this on your behalf.

#### 3rd Party 

Some apps may start the Oauth flow from 3rd party app stores, in such cases we would need to authenticate the user before handing off to the install flow.


#### API Call
